Blogger Templates
=================

The two .xml files are:

 - `template-stretch-denim-brents-color-scheme.xml` contains a similar
    color scheme as in `template-Son_of_Moto_Mean_Green_Blogging_Machine_variation.xml`
    but doesn't suffer from the skinny nature of the latter.

 - `template-Son_of_Moto_Mean_Green_Blogging_Machine_variation.xml` is
   the original template that is too skinny but has the right color
   scheme.

The Elisp file, `blogger_template_scanner.el`, is a set of utility
functions I used for scanning the CSS parts of the Blogger templates
